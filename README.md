Prime Number Checker with React and Memoization
This simple React app allows users to check whether a number is prime or not, utilizing memoization to optimize performance.

Features:

Input Field: Users can enter any number.

Prime Check: The app checks if the entered number is prime using a basic algorithm.

Memoization: The result is memoized using the useMemo hook, ensuring that the prime-check function is only recalculated when the number changes. This avoids unnecessary recalculations and improves performance, especially for expensive operations.

Key Technologies:

React.js: For building the user interface and managing the component state.

useMemo: React hook used to memoize the result of the prime-checking function to prevent unnecessary re-execution.

CSS: Basic styles for centering and enhancing the input field and result display.

How it works:
The user enters a number in the input field.
The app checks if the number is prime using a function that iterates up to the square root of the number.
The result (prime or not) is displayed below the input field.

Code snippet:
const isPrime = (num) => {
if (num < 2) return false;
for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
if (num % i === 0) return false;
}
return true;
};

Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies with npm install.
Run the app with npm start.
Enter a number and see whether itâ€™s prime or not!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
